# Santorini

## Food

* Amoodi Bay is a must for a Sunset dinner. The restaurants nearest the
cliffs give the best view. Get a table nearest the water.
* Dolphin Restaurant near Red Beach is great for an afternoon snack or lunch.
* Galini's taverna on Kamari beach does excellent local food. It's where
all the locals go!

## Beaches

* Red beach is nice be really busy and full of hired sun beds.
* White beach you need to get a boat to it.
* Black beach is a pebble beach is way quieter and has a lovely
taverna. You can find it by driving around the area near the
archaeologist excavation site.
* Perissa Beach is a beautiful long black pebble coast line.

## Places to Visit

Pirgos has great views. Lovely little shops if you walk up the hill. Interesting
place. Nice photos!!

Thirassia is a tiny local village not many tourists goto. It's a
traditional village where people still live in caves. Worth a look.

Kamari has an open air cinema. Which is a great place to after a
meal at Galini's.
